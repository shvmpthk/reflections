When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I am working in a team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because in some cases, i might not want my files to be changed, without my consent !

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is like a clone But ob your GitHub account.
    Clone is used to clone a repository on local machine from GitHub.
    Branches are used to add a new feature or modify exixting files for experimenting.

    Forking can be used to checkout other repositories and make our own versions of it along with others on GitHub.
    Cloning can be used to checkout repositories locally.
    Branch can be used to make changes in existing directory and contributing to the working repository.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Locally resolve merging conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without using Github, Collaboration would be done only by talking to each other nad then making the changes.
    Easy part would be there would be no merging issues.
    And Maintaining the versions would be harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Making changes in a seperate branch helps to test the changes in that branch first and testing it, before merging into master.
    Making changes to master branch directly could help in reducing the number of commits but may introduce unneccessary bugs and make the master branch undeplyable.
